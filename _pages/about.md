Welcome to my website !

I received my PhD in Economics from [Universit√© Sorbonne Paris Nord](https://act.univ-spn.fr/) in 2023.It is entitled [Trajectories and Determinants of Public Spending in the European Union: The Cases of Germany, France, and Greece](https://theses.fr/2023PA131028). 
<br>
I then completed a postdoctoral fellowship at [LIEPP](https://www.sciencespo.fr/liepp/fr/), Sciences Po, to study public aid in France and Europe. 
<br>
My research focuses on public finance, European integration, and macroeconomics.
