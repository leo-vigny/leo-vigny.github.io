    <p>The 1980s marked the transition from demand-driven Fordist policies to supply-driven ones, emphasizing budgetary discipline and competitiveness. However, this shift did not signal the end of fiscal interventionism but rather its transformation. In this paper, we introduce a novel indicator that encompasses all government-to-business wealth transfers, including direct expenditures and tax expenditures. This new measure offers a clearer picture of the level of government support for businesses. Findings reveal that French public aid surged over three decades, reaching 8% of GDP by 2019, making it the fastestgrowing budget item since the 1990s. Fiscal policy has not been abandoned in the post-Fordist era; it is now employed as a supply-side strategy rather than a demand-side one. We also evaluate this fiscal policy, showing that while state aid has a limited impact on employment and investment, it significantly boosts corporate margins after the Great Financial Crisis.</p>
